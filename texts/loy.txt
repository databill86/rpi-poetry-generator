Ostracized as we are with God 
The watchers of the civilized wastes 
reverse their signals on our track 

Lepers of the moon 
all magically diseased 
we come among you 
innocent 
of our luminous sores 

unknowing 
how perturbing lights 
our spirit 
on the passion of Man 
until you turn on us your smooth fools' faces 
like buttocks bared in aboriginal mockeries 

We are the sacerdotal clowns 
who feed upon the wind and stars 
and pulverous pastures of poverty 

Our wills are formed 
by curious disciplines 
beyond your laws 

You may give birth to us 
or marry us 
the chances of your flesh 
are not our destiny -- 

The cuirass of the soul 
still shines -- 
And we are unaware 
if you confuse 
such brief 
corrosion with possession 

In the raw caverns of the Increate 
we forge the dusk of Chaos 
to that imperious jewellery of the Universe 
-- the Beautiful -- 

While to your eyes 
A delicate crop 
of criminal mystic immortelles 
stands to the censor's scythe. 

The present implies presence
thus
unauthorized by the present
these letters are left authorless -- 
have lost all origin 
since the inscribing hand 
lost life.

The harshness of the past
croaks,
from creased leaves
covered with unwritten writing
since death's erasure
of the writer --
erased the lover

Well-chosen and so ill-relinquished
the husband heartsease --
acme of communion --

made euphonious
our esoteric universe.

Ego's oasis now's 
the sole companion.

My body and my reason 
you left to the drought of your dying:
the longing and the lack
of a racked creature
shouting 
to an unanswering hiatus
'reunite us!'

till slyly
patience creeps up on passion
and the elation of youth
dwindles out of season.

Agony 
ends in an equal grave 
with ecstasy.

An uneasy mist 
rises from this calligraphy of recollection
documenting a terror of dementia.

This package of ago
creaks with the horror of echo.

The bloom of love 
decoyed
to decay by the finger
of Hazard the swindler --
deathly handler who leaves
no post-mortem mask
but a callous earth.

Posing the extreme enigma
in my Bewilderness
can your face excelling Adonis
have ceased to be
or ever have had existence?

With you no longer the addresser
there is no addressee
to dally with defunct reality.

Can one who still has being 
be inexistent?

I am become 
dumb
in answer
to your dead language of amor.

Diminuendo
of life's imposture
implies no possible retrial
by my present self --
my cloud-corpse
beshadowing your shroud.

The one I was with you:
inhumed in chasms.
No creator
reconstrues scar-tissue
to shine as birth-star.

But to my sub-cerebral surprise
at last on blase sorrow
dawns an iota of disgust
for life's intemperance:

'As once you were'

Withhold your ghostly reference
to the sweet once were we.

Leave me
my final illiteracy
of memory's languor --

my preference
to drift in lenient coma
an older Ophelia
on Lethe. 

Spawn of Fantasies
Silting the appraisable
Pig Cupid his rosy snout
Rooting erotic garbage
'Once upon a time'
Pulls a weed white star-topped
Among wild oats sown in mucous-membrane

I would an eye in a Bengal light
Eternity in a sky-rocket
Constellations in an ocean
Whose rivers run no fresher
Than a trickle of saliva

These are suspect places

I must live in my lantern
Trimming subliminal flicker
Virginal to the bellows
Of Experience

Coloured glass 

Face of the skies
preside
over our wonder.

Fluorescent
truant of heaven
draw us under.

Silver, circular corpse
your decease
infects us with unendurable ease,

touching nerve-terminals
to thermal icicles

Coercive as coma, frail as bloom
innuendoes of your inverse dawn
suffuse the self;
our every corpuscle become an elf. 

A silver Lucifer
serves
cocaine in cornucopia

To some somnambulists
of adolescent thighs
draped
in satirical draperies

Peris in livery
prepare
Lethe
for posthumous parvenues

Delirious Avenues
lit
with the chandelier souls
of infusoria
from Pharoah's tombstones

lead
to mercurial doomsdays
Odious oasis
in furrowed phosphorous---

the eye-white sky-light
white-light district
of lunar lusts

---Stellectric signs
"Wing shows on Starway"
"Zodiac carrousel"

Cyclones
of ecstatic dust
and ashes whirl
crusaders
from hallucinatory citadels
of shattered glass
into evacuate craters

A flock of dreams 
browse on Necropolis

From the shores
of oval oceans
in the oxidized Orient

Onyx-eyed Odalisques
and ornithologists
observe
the flight
of Eros obsolete

And "Immortality"
mildews...
in the museums of the moon

"Nocturnal cyclops"
"Crystal concubine"
-------
Pocked with personification
the fossil virgin of the skies
waxes and wanes----
