Headline language poetry, nine decades after Democratic Vistas 
      and the Prophecy of the Good Gray Poet
            Our nation "of the fabled damned"
                                    or else . . .
      Language, language
Ezra Pound the Chinese Written Character for truth

                              The war is language,
                                    language abused
                                          for Advertisement,
                                    language used
                              like magic for power on the planet:
Black Magic language,
      formulas for reality- 
            Communism is a 9 letter word
                  used by inferior magicians with
the wrong alchemical formula for transforming earth into gold
            -funky warlocks operating on guesswork, 
                  handmedown mandrake terminology
                                    that never worked in 1956
      for gray-domed Dulles,
                              brooding over at State,
            that never worked for Ike who knelt to take 
                        the magic wafer in his mouth
                                          from Dulles' hand
                                    inside the church in Washington:
Communion of bum magicians
                  congress of failures from Kansas & Missouri
      working with the wrong equations
      Sorcerer's Apprentices who lost control

                                    Language
O longhaired magician come home take care of your dumb helper 
      before the radiation deluge floods your livingroom,
                              your magic errandboy's
                                    just made a bad guess again
                        that's lasted a whole decade.

While this American nation argues war:
            conflicting language, language
                              proliferating in airwaves
      filling the farmhouse ear, filling

            the pupil's head at the movies
                  blond haired, his heart throbbing with desire

                                    that fabled damned of nations 
                                    prophecy come true- 
Though the highway's straight,
      dipping downward through low hills,
      rising narrow on the far horizon
            black cows browse in caked fields
                  ponds in the hollows lie frozen
                                    quietness.
Is this the land that started war on China?
      This be the soil that thought Cold War for decades? 
      Are these nervous naked trees & farmhouses
                                    the vortex
                              of oriental anxiety molecules
      that've imagined        American Foreign Policy
            and magick'd up paranoia in Peking
                        and curtains of living blood
                              surrounding far Saigon?
Are these the towns where the language emerged 
      from the mouths here
                  that makes a Hell of riots in Dominica
      sustains the aging tyranny of Chiang in silent Taipeh city 
      Paid for the lost French war in Algeria
            overthrew the Guatemalan polis in '54

Here's Marysville-

and the Track Crossing
      with Cotton Belt flatcars
                  carrying autos west from Dallas
      Delaware & Hudson gondolas filled with power stuff- 
      a line of boxcars far east as the eye can see
                  carrying battle goods to cross the Rockies
            into the hands of rich longshoremen loading
                                    ships on the Pacific- 
            Oakland Army Terminal lights
                        blue illumined all night now-
Crash of couplings and the great American train
                  moves on carrying its cushioned load of metal doom 
      Union Pacific linked together with your Hoosier Line
                        followed by passive Wabash
                                          rolling behind
                        all Erie carrying cargo in the rear,
                  Central Georgia's rust colored truck proclaiming 
                                          The Right Way, concluding
      the awesome poem writ by the train
                  across northern Kansas,
            land which gave right of way
            to the massing of metal meant for explosion
                                          in Indochina- 
Passing thru Waterville,
      Electronic machinery in the bus humming prophecy- 
            paper signs blowing in cold wind,
                        mid-Sunday afternoon's silence in town
            under frost-gray sky
                              that covers the horizon- 
That the rest of earth is unseen,
                                    an outer universe invisible,
                              Unknown except thru
                                                language

or prophecy of the secret
                              heart the same
                              in Waterville as Saigon one human form:
                        When a woman's heart bursts in Waterville
                                    a woman screams equal in Hanoi- 
On to Wichita to prophesy! O frightful Bard!
      into the heart of the Vortex
            where anxiety rings
                  the University with millionaire pressure,
            lonely crank telephone voices sighing in dread, 
      and students waken trembling in their beds
            with dreams of a new truth warm as meat,
            little girls suspecting their elders of murder
                  committed by remote control machinery,
            boys with sexual bellies aroused
                  chilled in the heart by the mailman
            with a letter from an aging white haired General 
                  Director of selection for service in Deathwar
                  all this black language
                                    writ by machine!
                        O hopeless Fathers and Teachers 
                        in Hué     do you know
                                          the same woe too?
                                          
I'm an old man now, and a lonesome man in Kansas
          but not afraid
                    to speak my lonesomeness in a car,
                    because not only my lonesomeness
                                it's Ours, all over America,
                                                     O tender fellows--
                                & spoken lonesomeness is Prophecy
                                in the moon 100 years ago or in
                                          the middle of Kansas now.
It's not the vast plains mute our mouths
                                that fill at midnite with ecstatic language
                     when our trembling bodies hold each other
                                breast to breast on a matress--
            Not the empty sky that hides
                                           the feeling from our faces
            nor our skirts and trousers that conceal
                     the bodylove emanating in a glow of beloved skin,
                                white smooth abdomen down to the hair
                                                                between our legs,
            It's not a God that bore us that forbid
                     our Being, like a sunny rose
                                          all red with naked joy
                     between our eyes & bellies, yes
All we do is for this frightened thing
                     we call Love, want and lack--
            fear that we aren't the one whose body could be
                     beloved of all the brides of Kansas City,
                     kissed all over by every boy of Wichita--
            O but how many in their solitude weep aloud like me--
                     On the bridge over the Republican River
                                almost in tears to know
                                           how to speak the right language--
                     on the frosty broad road
                                uphill between highway embankments
                     I search for the language
                                          that is also yours--
                                almost all our language has been taxed by war.
Radio antennae high tension
           wires ranging from Junction City across the plains--
           highway cloverleaf sunk in a vast meadow
                                lanes curving past Abilene
                                          to Denver filled with old
                                                               heroes of love--
                                to Wichita where McClure's mind
                                          burst into animal beauty
                                          drunk, getting laid in a car
                                                     in a neon misted street
                                                               15 years ago--
           to Independence where the old man's still alive
           who loosed the bomb that's slaved all human consciousness
                             and made the body universe a place of fear--
Now, speeding along the empty plain,
                      no giant demon machine
                                visible on the horizon
           but tiny human trees and wooden houses at the sky's edge
                      I claim my birthright!
                                reborn forever as long as Man
                                          in Kansas or other universe--Joy
                      reborn after the vast sadness of War Gods!
A lone man talking to myself, no house in the brown vastness to hear,
                      imaging the throng of Selves
                                 that make this nation one body of Prophecy
                                          languaged by Declaration as
                                                     Happiness!

                                          nameless Mystery--
published to my own senses,
                               blissfully received by my own form
            approved with pleasure by my sensations
                       manifestation of my very thought
                       accomplished in my own imagination
                               all realms within my consciousness fulfilled
            60 miles from Wichita
                                          near El Dorado,
                                                     The Golden One,
in chill earthly mist
            houseless brown farmland plains rolling heavenward
                                                                        in every direction
one midwinter afternoon Sunday called the day of the Lord--
            Pure Spring Water gathered in one tower
                                  where Florence is
                                                        set on a hill,
                                  stop for tea & gas
