# Raspberry Pi Interactive Poetry Generator
Interactive poetry generator
- Uses physical light and distance from hardware sensors to determine tone and line spacing
  - Lots of light will generate lines with positive sentiment, while
    complete darkness will generate lines with negative sentiment
  - Closeness to sensor will generate shorter lines, while being very far away
    will generate longer lines
- Uses natural language processing models to analyze text sentiment and build
  ngrams for generating lines of poetry

Inspired by Lyn
Hejinian's [constant change
figures](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/184117) and Mina Loy's 
[Letters of the
Living](http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/letters-of-the-unliving/)

Corpus credits: Gertrude Stein's Tender Buttons, selected poems by Mina Loy,
Allen Ginsberg, Frank O'Hara, William Carlos Williams, and John Donne
