# Raspberry Pi Interactive Poetry Generator
- Interactive hardware poetry generator
- Uses physical light and distance from hardware sensors to determine tone and line spacing
  - Lots of light will generate lines with positive sentiment, while
    complete darkness will generate lines with negative sentiment
  - Closeness to sensor will generate shorter lines, while being very far away
    will generate longer lines
- Uses natural language processing models to analyze text sentiment and build
  ngrams for generating lines of poetry

Inspired by Lyn
Hejinian's [constant change
figures](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/184117) and Mina Loy's 
[Letters of the
Living](http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/letters-of-the-unliving/)

Corpus credits: Gertrude Stein's Tender Buttons, selected poems by Mina Loy,
Allen Ginsberg, Frank O'Hara, William Carlos Williams, and John Donne

### Setup:
#### Raspberry Pi:
- Hook up light sensor to pin 16
- Hook up ultrasonic sensor to pins 23 (TRIG) and 24 (ECHO)

We worked on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B V1.1:

#### To run:
- Install the [TextBlob](http://textblobac.readthedocs.org/en/dev/) NLP library
```
$ pip install -U textblob
$ python -m textblob.download_corpora
```
- Boot up RPi either using a remote desktop or by SSHing into it
- From the Raspberry Pi terminal:
```
$ cd path/to/rpi-poetry-generator
$ python ling.py
```

#### To modify input corpus:
- Add/remove .txt files in the `texts` folder


### Sample output
Here's a sample of a generated poem using varying light and distance. Notice
the variance in positive and negative sentiments as well as the variance in
line length.
